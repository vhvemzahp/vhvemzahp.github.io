This call to treat one another accordingly can be an intentional effort to take on, aided by the grace of God and a biblical understanding of what it means to act \"like family.\"\nLet's unpack these principles in more detail, so we can put them into practice in our churches and personal lives.\n1. Put others first in love Philippians 2:3–4 tells us to “do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.” This is the essence of sacrificial love, which we see exhibited by Christ Himself. In your relationships with fellow believers, look for opportunities to put their needs ahead of your own. You may even have to reevaluate your priorities and preferences—be willing to give up something in order to serve and love others as a part of your spiritual family.\n2. Forgive freely and quickly As members of one family, we must be quick to forgive one another when hurts occur (Ephesians 4:32). Remember, in the grand scheme of things, sin within the family of God doesn’t define who we are or determine our eternal destiny. While we don’t deny the weight and pain of sin, we know that when a genuine repentance process takes place, it is met with God's forgiveness (1 John 1:9), and we are called to participate in that provision. Learn to extend forgiveness because, at the core, we are all still sinners, only made righteous by grace.\n3. Show honor and respect Honor others, as biblically exemplified in Romans 12:10, where we are instructed to \"be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor.\" Just as we show respect to our biological family members and friends, so should we do with other believers. Recognize and respect their unique gifts and passions, and let them serve in the roles designated by God to nurture the growth and unity of the whole.\n4. Seek out reconciliation There will be times when misunderstandings and conflicts arise within the church or in your relationships with other believers. Follow 1 Corinthians 1:10: \"I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and there be no divisions among you, and that you be united in the same mind and purpose.” While a completely unified and frictionless existence is not possible in this fallen world, we should actively seek to preserve harmony and unity where appropriate, ensuring that our hearts are set upon glorifying God, and not pursuing our own self-interests.\n5. Pray for each other The power of prayer should never be underestimated, especially when it comes to aiding in our relationships with fellow believers. 1 Thessalonians 5:11-13 encourages us to “encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing. But we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do this with greater earnestness. Make habitual progress, devoting yourselves to spiritual work. Encourage and console one another in view of all the instability that goes with trials, in order that you may bring yourselves to a perfect and mature standard of development.” Take time to pray with and for others, and to ask for their prayer. In doing so, you will build upon the unity of the Spirit as well as edify each other.\n6. Encourage one another’s gifts and strengths 1 Peter 4:10 exhorts that, “Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God’s grace in its various forms.” When you notice unique qualities and talents within other believers, take time to spur them on (Hebrews 10:24-25), helping to develop, exercise, and use these gifts to the glory of God.\n7. Be inclusive and hospitable to others The New Testament often highlights hospitality as a significant value within the church community (Rom 12:13; 3 John 1:2, 8; 1 Peter 4:9; Heb 13:2), demonstrating the heart of a spiritual family. It encourages us to be open and warm, inviting others into our lives, homes, and the larger church community. Being inclusive and hospitable fosters unity, belonging and creates a healthy environment for all generations and walks of life to participate in the family of God.\nConclusion Walking together as parts of the same spiritual family within the body of Christ can be incredibly rewarding, yet also challenging. As you seek to embody these characteristics, be patient, pray, and lean on the Lord's grace for strength. It's not about achieving perfection, but rather, a journey of intentional, humble love. Doing so will contribute to a powerful witness of what true Christian community looks like in our world.\n","wordCount":"812","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-13T01:48:34Z","dateModified":"2024-03-13T01:48:34Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://vhvemzahp.github.io/posts/66685978-how-to-actually-treat-other-believers-like-family/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Vhvemzahp","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://vhvemzahp.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://vhvemzahp.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Vhvemzahp (Alt + H)">Vhvemzahp</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How to Actually Treat Other Believers Like Family</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-13 01:48:34 +0000 UTC'>March 13, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="1.
