I have had the privilege of working with many churches across the nation in helping them clarify their purpose and focus on reaching people for Jesus Christ. This has allowed me to witness a variety of approaches, successes and failures. Through this experience, one significant key to the success or failure of these strategic meetings has become clear: What makes church consultations thrive or falter is the extent to which all the key leaders of the church become unified and cohesively committed to the process.\nAlignment – The Key to Successful Consultations Alignment is a significant key. Without full alignment or unity, consultatilns can face a multitude of challenges that end up limiting a church’s ability to experience significant growth and progress as they work towards God-glorifying, people-reaching objectives. Now, I don’t claim to have a crystal ball or perfect understanding of every situation. However, based on my experience, the following reasons seem prevalent in this context.\nTo successfully traverse the strategic consultation process, everyone on the church leadership team must:\nBecome participants, not mere observers. Every person, from the senior pastor to the various committee heads must buy into the process and actively engage in the conversation. Too often, I see a disconnect or lack of complete participation from a select few who might feel that the process is ‘the pastor’s’ idea, or they may subconsciously believe that they have more critical tasks to fulfill—making it hard for the process to move forward effectively.\nView the purpose and process as unifying, not divisive. In reality, there are times when church leaders have prior differences or unresolved issues between them. These tensions can flare up during the process and derail the efforts. Therefore, it is critical to recognize and deal with these challenges head-on.\nBe willing to yield to the greater good. This might involve laying aside personal preferences or agendas. Sometimes certain committees or individuals might have to adjust or relinquish their priorities for the future growth and impact of the whole church. This is not an easy step and could bring tensuion. But it is a necessary aspect if the church is going to genuinely make progress.\nPractice mutual trust and accountability. The process entails a level of vulnerability where personal opinions and priorities are aired, debated and adjusted. There has to be a deep-rooted trust in one another’s heart for God and desire to glorify Him through the church. This trust opens the door to beneficial dialogue and ultimately, better decisions.\nStrive for win-win solutions. The goal of the church consultation process is not simply to ‘get things done,’ but rather, to develop a shared sense of purpose and vision among the church leadership. This means leaders should seek to agree where they can; finding common ground is crucial. It is vital that each leader is willing to lay down their personal gain for the greater good of the entire church body.\nIn conclusion, alignment may not necessarily guarantee immediate success for the church consultation process, but the lack of it significantly increases the risk of failure. Alignment is a critical pre-requisite that unlocks a collaborative approach, and, in turn, enables the church to fulfill its calling to reach people with the life-transforming message of Jesus Christ.\nConclusion I believe these reasons genuinely reflect how the church consultation process thrives or fails. It’s imperative for church leaders to carefully consider them when undertaking such a process. May the Lord grant you wisdom as you chart your path forward!
