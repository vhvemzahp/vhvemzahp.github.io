It is riddled with times of triumph as well as utter heartbreak. I have walked through a valley as dark as death. In this experience, one of the most important things that I learned was how to build confidence in God. In this article, I am going to share with you four keys to this process during some of the most difficult circumstances you may face.\nKey One: Tear Down Skepticism I can’t tell you how many times I tried to pick apart and discredit God’s goodness while walking through the darkest season of my life. I tried to make His love relative to the pain and difficulty I was encountering. If you find yourself on the path of skepticism and doubt, you must stop in your tracks. In the words of Rachel Held Evans, “We learn to pray with our doubts, not in spite of them.” One of the first steps in building confidence in God, especially when life feels like it's falling apart, is to tear down skepticism.\nThis means you must allow yourself to be honest with God. You don’t have to put on a facade. God already knows your heart. You can be the one lone believer who openly asks, “Where are You, God? This hurts. I don’t get it. Why is my life like this?” In the face of these questions, God never flees, and He never loses hope in you.\nKey Two: Remember the Power of Biblical Truth During my own dark time, I held on for my life to the powerful truths of Scripture. I learned to memorize verses that reminded me of God’s unfailing love, His power to work all things for good, and His promise to never leave me or forsake me. While I might have been unable to keep my head above water, God used these truths to bolster my foundation, keeping me securely anchored to the eternal promise of a faithful God. As the words of Scripture filled my soul, I could not deny their power, and confidence began to grow within me once more.\nFor example, you might find great peace as you meditate on the following promises from God:\nPsalm 34:8 - \"O taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him.\" Jeremiah 29:11 - \"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.\" Romans 8:28 - \"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who are called according to His purpose.\" Isaiah 41:10 - \"Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.\" These truths, and the many others found in the Bible, can bring confidence to your heart when you feel overwhelmed.\nKey Three: Establish an Active Relationship One of the most impactful decisions I made during my difficult season was to invest in an active relationship with God. No longer could I sit passively by and expect to make it through the hard times. God was calling me to roll up my sleeves and actively engage in a life-saving partnership with the God who promised never to abandon me (Deuteronomy 31:6). I reached out through prayer, confessing my doubts, worship, the study of God’s word, and constant conversation through the day. In short, I sought to be the Christian who held nothing back from the One who promised to never hold anything back for me.\nAs an active partner in your own relationship with Christ, you too can navigate through the darkest moments while clinging tightly to the hope that can only be found in God.\nKey Four: Learn From Experience On the other side of my darkest hour, I realized something of paramount importance. The experience, though painstaking, had done something extraordinary in my life. It had brought me to a new level of faith and trust in God. In the midst of the suffering, I had been given the ability to look up and see the very hand of God at work. In the darkness, the light of the world had shone brightly. God had proven Himself to be true in His promises, faithful in His character, and reliable in His compassion and care. In the midst of a dark night, He had allowed the light of His presence to show me the way (Psalm 119:105).\nTo build confidence in God through life's most difficult moments, you must be willing to learn the lessons they teach. They can show you beyond a shadow of a doubt that God is for you, not against you, even when circumstances try to paint a different picture.\nThe other side of life’s trials is something only you can discover with a willing heart, a Bible firmly in hand, and an active partnership with the God who loves and adores you. As you can now see, there is power in tearing down skepticism, leaning on the promises of Scripture, cultivating a vibrant relationship with God, and learning the lessons life presents. As you walk this path, your confidence in God will only continue to grow.\nResources\nEvans, Rachel Held. Faith Unraveled: Using Your Doubts to Deepen Your Faith. Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2014.\nQuestion: What Should We Do When Fear Overpowers Our Faith? Answer: When fear overtakes our faith, we must take the necessary steps to refocus our attention, reengage our faith, and realign our perspective with biblical truth. Here are a few practical actions to help in such situations:\nTake Stock of Your Emotions: Acknowledge the fear and the sense of being overwhelmed. There is no shame in feeling afraid—even the disciples struggled with fear at times. Honesty with ourselves helps prevent our fears from festering.\nSeek Solace in Scripture: Memorize, meditate, and immerse yourself in God's promises. Their assurances serve as a beacon of hope in the darkness, reinforcing our confidence in God despite our uncertain feelings.\nCultivate a Vibrant Relationship with God: Turn to direct conversations with the Lord—prayer, confession, thanksgiving, and praise. The Lord desires an active partnership with us, one where we don't shy away from expressing our deepest emotions. This connection fortifies our spiritual muscle and can ultimately alleviate our fears.\nLean on Spiritual Mentors and Community: Isolation only magnifies our fears. Fellowship with other believers, sharing our experiences, and receiving encouragement from God's Word through a pastor, small group, or spiritual friend can provide significant support.\nFocus on Obedience: Inaction due to fear robs us of our ability to trust and grow. Maintain a determination to obey God, no matter how you feel. Doing so reestablishes our submission to the Lord, allowing our faith to reclaim its rightful place.\nRemember, faith and fear are not mutually exclusive extremes; they often coexist in our hearts. But God equips and empowers those willing to confront their fears and cling to the promises of His Word. By consistently practicing these steps, you can regain faith's upper hand and combat the fear attempting to dominate it.\nRelated Article: Learning to Overcome Fear: Spiritual Practices that Cultivate Courage and Hope\nArticle Posted In: Christianity Resources\nQuestion: How Do I Strengthen My Faith in God During Times of Trial? Answer: Building and maintaining faith in God amidst life's difficulties requires intentionality, focus, and effort. Here are a few suggestions to strengthen your faith during trying times:\nRegularly Dive into God's Word: The Bible is our foundation as Christians, providing truth, guidance, hope, and encouragement. By daily studying and meditating on Scripture, your mind will be continually reoriented towards trust in God.\nBuild an Active, Honest Prayer Life: In the dark hours, communication with God becomes essential. Share your burdens, doubts, and concerns—and thank Him for His faithfulness, even when you struggle to see it.\nEngage in Worship Despite Doubt: Worship may feel hollow or inauthentic in the midst of suffering, yet it plays a pivotal role in re-orienting our focus towards the divine. Regardless of emotions, practice praising and thanking the Lord.\nInvest in a Circle of Support: Surround yourself with loving, Christian friends, mentors or counsel\n","wordCount":"1390","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-29T11:50:58Z","dateModified":"2024-02-29T11:50:58Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://vhvemzahp.github.io/posts/59379427-4-keys-to-building-confidence-in-god-when-life-falls-apart/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Vhvemzahp","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://vhvemzahp.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://vhvemzahp.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Vhvemzahp (Alt + H)">Vhvemzahp</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 Keys to Building Confidence in God When Life Falls Apart</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-29 11:50:58 +0000 UTC'>February 29, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Key One: Tear Down Skepticism">Key One: Tear Down Skepticism</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Key Two: Remember the Power of Biblical Truth">Key Two: Remember the Power of Biblical Truth</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Key Three: Establish an Active Relationship">Key Three: Establish an Active Relationship</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Key Four: Learn From Experience">Key Four: Learn From Experience</a></li></ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Question: What Should We Do When Fear Overpowers Our Faith?">Question: What Should We Do When Fear Overpowers Our Faith?</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Question: How Do I Strengthen My Faith in God During Times of Trial?">Question: How Do I Strengthen My Faith in God During Times of Trial?</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>As I’m sure you know, life is full of ups and downs.
