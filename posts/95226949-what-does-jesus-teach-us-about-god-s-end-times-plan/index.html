Since time immemorial, people have speculated about the end of the world and have eagerly devoured any new theories that crop up. It is also common for people to look to religious teachings for answers. When it comes to Christianity, what does Jesus teach us about God's \"end-times\" plan?\nThis question is complex. What Jesus taught directly has been interpreted and retold in the Gospels - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - written over a century after His death. The Gospels present a mixed bag of information and contain specific teachings, parables, sayings, and miracles. In trying to learn Jesus' view on end times, we will need to explore the relevant passages.\nIn his book Jesus and the End of the World, Marcus Borg challenges the long-held views of Jesus' predictions regarding the \"End of the World.\" He states that all the \"apocalyptic\" passages in the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) were later embellished by the early Christian community with \"apocalyptic\" ideas popular at that time.\nHowever, because we lack an original \"eyewitness\" written account from the Apostles who walked with Jesus, we must rely on these four Gospel texts and interpret them in light of a deeper understanding of history, the Hebrew prophetic tradition and the general beliefs of first century Jews.\nThree Synoptic Gospels: Parallels in Teaching on End-Times In exploring the end-times teaching of Jesus, we find that the accounts in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are similar. They are referred to as the Synoptic Gospels as they can be synchronized in their telling. Here are selected passages that help shape our understanding of Jesus' teachings:\nMark 13: The Olivet Discourse The longest continuous discourse on the end-times in the Synoptic Gospels is recorded by Mark in a chapter called \"The Olivet Discourse.\" Here, Jesus tells His disciples to understand His coming destruction of the temple as a sign, but one that should not distract them from the true signs of the \"end.\" Some of these other signs include wars, earthquakes, famines, persecutions, false prophets, the preaching of the gospel to all nations, the appearance of apostasy (faithlessness) and the abomination of desolation in a holy place. All these events would precede the \"end\" (see Mark 13).\nJesus emphasizes that no one, including Himself, knows when this would happen, and warns against people misleading through claims of specific dates or events (Mark 13:32).\nMatthew 24: Jesus' reply to questions in private A parallel account of the Olivet Discourse is found in Matthew 24, in which Jesus talks of end times, signs preceding it, and the unknowability of the date. However, in Matthew's version, He also discusses the \"coming of the Son of Man\" and the resultant separation of humans into two groups: those for Him, and those against Him (see Matt 24:36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 44, 46, 50). This part is not found in Mark's version.\nLuke 21: A Compilation from Previous Two Gospels Luke 21 records another account, compiling elements from both the Mark and Matthew versions. As Luke 21:5-38 is almost exactly the same as Mark 13, some sections are usually skipped in reading the parallel accounts.\nTwo Points of Agreement In these three synoptic accounts, there are two major points of agreement. First, Jesus identifies a set of ominous events (wars, natural disasters, deceit, and so on) that would mark the \"approach\" of the \"end-time,\" yet not the \"end\" itself. He further emphasizes His unknowable timing.\nThis was undoubtedly connected to His Jewish upbringing, as the prophetic writings of the Hebrew Bible often spoke of a great \"day of the Lord,\" an end to evil and suffering and the fulfillment of God's promises for His people.\nThe second point is less explicit, yet still present. Jesus' predictions seem to give hope and confidence to a small, harassed band of followers. In talking about these end-time events, He appears to encourage them. They could endure the current persecution knowing that God was closer to acting decisively.\nIn this interpretation, then, Jesus isn't giving specific predictions of future events that would play out linearly, like those of Nostradamus or Jeane Dixon. Rather, He provides His disciples with some general signs they might look for and assurance that God would work ultimately to bring about justice and redemption.\nConclusion It is essential to note that the study of end-times in the New Testament goes beyond these Synoptic Gospel passages. But these form the central reference base.\nDiscussions of Jesus' \"end-times\" teachings should be approached with caution, and without forgetting the context in which these texts were produced. Jesus' eschatology, in these teachings, is part of His overall message about the Kingdom of God and how His followers can live for the same, now and towards the \"end.\"\nIn sumary, Jesus doesn't give specific or definitive dates. He teaches about a sequence of events that could signal the \"end,\" and emphasizes that only God the Father holds complete knowledge of the \"end's\" timeline. In the meantime, His followers should look for the spiritual fulfillment that the coming of the Kingdom can bring.\nQuestions \u0026 Answers © 2012 Rajan Shrestha\nComments Author AUTHOR Rajan Shrestha 2 years ago from Деलхи, INDIA\nThanks for stopping by Edwin. I am glad to hear that. Yes, the 'Apocalyptic' verses of Jesus found in Synoptic Gospels are subject to interpretation and debate. I personally lean towards seeing them in the context of Jewish messianic expectations and the backdrop of earlier prophetic literature. That said, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of a distortion due to theological interpretations of the early Christian community. Also, as you said, the teachings are a part of larger message of Christ about living for the 'Kingdom' right here, right now. - Edwin Parreira from Lubbock, Texas, USA horizonCALLINGS - The Poetry, Prose, and Musings of Wes WINtringham \u0026others + Me + You since August 2017 on Medium.com ... on Flipboard since Jan 2016 ... on HubPages since 2012 ... on Squidoo since 2009 19 hours ago\nI remember how my Pastor, Dr. Shirley Oaks would often reiterate that while the Gospels, including the Apocalyptic verses of Jesus, are open to interpretation, the larger message of the 'life in Kingdom' is inescapable.
