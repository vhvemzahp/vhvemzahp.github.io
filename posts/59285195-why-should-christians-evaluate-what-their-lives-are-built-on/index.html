It's an important question to contemplate.\nThinking deeply about the foundations of our lives is a powerful means of maintaining a clear focus on what truly matters in our walk with God. It enables us to re-evaluate and re-adjust our priorities, recognizing whether we're living in line with the teachings of the Bible.\nJesus famously asked His hearers this question in Luke 6:47-49: \"Whoever comes to me, and hears my words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like: He is like a man building a house, who dug deep, and laid a foundation upon a rock; when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it had been well built. But the one who hears and does not act, is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the floodwaters at once burst in, and eroded away that house, and he was left destitute.\" (ISV)\nSo, how can we ensure our lives are properly built? In this article, we'll explore the reasons why Christians need to evaluate their lives in light of their beliefs, and provide some steps on how to do that effectively.\n1. Differentiate Between Worldly and Heavenly Perspectives The first step in understanding why our Christian lives should be evaluated is to comprehend the stark differences between the world's standard of success and godly principles. The world may praise and reward individuals based on wealth, status, looks, or power. However, God's measure of worth differs from ours. As 1 Peter 1:18 states, \"knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life, inherited from your ancestors\" (NASB). Understanding this helps us establish our focus on a heavenly perspective instead of a worldly one.\n2. Ensuring Alignment with God's Will To build our lives on a solid Christian foundation, we must make sure our life choices and practices align with God's plan for us. The New Testament repeatedly stresses the importance of pursuing the righteousness and holiness that God calls His people to live by (1 Peter 3:15, Romans 6:17â€“18, 2 Tim 3:16-17). Regular self-examination is a healthy practice that aids in identifying areas where we may have deviated from His way.\n3. Prevent Misplaced Priorities Failure to evaluate our lives can lead to the pursuit of values that compete with God's agenda. In Matthew 6:33, Jesus advises, \"But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.\" When we don't continually assess our faith journey, our priorities could inadvertently shift towards wealth, career advancement, or personal happiness at the expense of obedience to God's calling. Evaluation prevents this.\n4. Encourage Spiritual Growth Christian growth demands consistent self-assessment and self-reflection. As James 4:6 advises: \"God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\" As followers of Christ, it's important to maintain a humble posture, recognizing our need to grow and learn as disciples. We're called to \"work out our salvation with fear and trembling\" (Philippians 2:12), knowing that without God's help, we'd never achieve it.\n5. Reinforce Accountability to God As believers, we're ultimately accountable to God for the way we've spent our lives. Paul, in 2 Corinthians 5:10, asserts, \"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed according to his deeds in the body, whether good or evil.\" This challenge requires a continuous monitoring of our adherence to His commands.\nConclusion In summary, evaluating our lives in light of the foundational relationship with Jesus Christ helps to keep our priorities in line with a heavenly rather than earthly perspective; ensures alignment with God's will; prevents misplaced priorities; encourages spiritual growth; and reminds us of the ultimate accountability before our Creator. By conducting regular self-examination, we can further fortify our homes in the truth, regardless of any storms that may come.\nQuestions \u0026 Answers Q: How often is self-assessment or evaluation recommended for Christians?\nA: There's no specific frequency given for self-assessment or evaluation, but regularity is encouraged to maintain awareness of the condition of our relationship with God and our adherence to His will. It can be helpful to set aside intentional times of introspection, such as in personal retreats, times of prayerful reflection, regular Bible study or accountability discussion with others.\nQ: Can evaluation result in self-condemnation for Christians?\nA: While evaluation is an essential practice, it's crucial that we approach it in a spirit of love, humility, and self-awareness. With God's grace and the support of a Christian community, our moments of self-scrutiny should encourage repentance and growth, not instill unhealthy self-condemnation. Focus should remain primarily on God's grace and forgiveness.\nÂ© 2020 Alexandra Kerven\nComments No comments yet.

It signifies the intimacy of believers' relationship with God and the responsibility to concentrate on the heavenly kingdom as an essential part of their daily lives. Practicing this mindset is a testament to a biblical, Christ-like, worldview.\nWhenever one carries the moniker 'Christ's Little Flock', it reveals an intention to remain spiritually alert, fully committed to the Christian way of life as prescribed by the Bible, and to uphold orthodox Christian values. It does not mean refusing to live or engage in the world, but rather directs a godly perspective within the earthly realm.\nBeing part of 'Christ's Little Flock' conveys a sense of reverence and honor for all that has been given â€“ the Gospel message, salvation, God's guidance, and the hope of eternal life. It highlights a dedication to share this Good News with others and a longing for the Lord's return.\nIn a practical sense, embracing this outlook involves: 1. Clinging to Jesus Christ for eternal salvation and living a life shaped by the Holy Spirit. 2. Immersion in the Scriptures, seeking to understand and apply God's word, the ultimate authority in all things. 3. Relying on God for the daily provision of life and living simply in comparison to the world's standards to avoid materialism's entrapment. 4. Emphasizing the importance of mutual love, support, and community for the followers of Jesus Christ. 5. Prioritizing the Gospel message, sharing the life-saving Word with others while also demonstrating God's love through actions. 6.
