In my own life journey, I've found a strange thing; I never run out of questions. I'm still learning as if I'm new, and, in many ways, the longer I live, the more I see how vast and profound God is. I've decided to break this message into two parts. The first part will be for new Christians, and the second part will be for older Christians. But in truth, you'll note, I believe we could all take a stab at refining each of these lessons, no matter what our age in the faith. I trust that whether you're freshly, or well-seasoned in Jesus, there may be a few helpful gems here.\nPart One: 9 Lessons for New Christians Surrendering To Christ Means ALL Of You Christianity is not a la carte. There is no fine print that says, \"Ok, you can keep parts of yourself and only try to follow on Sunday.\" Jesus said, \"If anyone would come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me\" (Matthew 16:24). This means that wherever you've been, whoever you've been, and whatever you've been doing, you are called to embrace change when you step into the Christian life, and to offer all of yourself to God. The transformation will be life-long. It won't always be easy, but it is an unbelievable adventure.\nThe Bible - The Essential Guide to Your New Journey The Bible is our owner's manual. In it, you'll find the words of God, the inspirations of faith heroes, and practical guidance for the Christian life. As a new Christian, you'll want to start reading the Book right away. Get help finding a good place to start by joining a group or asking for recommendations.\nYour Salvation Is Not Earned by Good Deeds or Nice Attitudes Alone Though both actions matter, salvation is an undeserved free gift from God. The foundation of your new life lies in God's grace, received through faith in Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. God's free pardon is for you, it's for sinners. Remember that in the good days and the bad.\nThe Church Is A Place Where You'll Grow, But It May Not Always Be Perfect You are entering a community of sinners in the process of being transformed by God's grace. Churches are made of people, and therefore are far fr om perfect. Don't allow the perceived failures of the body to deter you. Instead, stay committed to the mission and to personal growth.\nStay Teachable and Humble Everyone has something to learn from Jesus and from His people. As a new Christian, this is a time to learn, to grow, and to be malleable. Don't be proud of your new faith, but eager to learn it. Seek wise counsel from those more experienced. Be ready to let go of old ideas, and to develop new ones that reflect your new commitment to Jesus.\nPrayer Is How You Talk With God Start building a consistent habit of prayer. It's how you communicate with God, talk to Him about the big and little things in your life. Ask for wisdom, forgiveness, and for help with following Jesus. The more you pray, the more your faith comes alive.\nYou May Encounter Spiritual Struggles Following Jesus doesn't mean a life without problems. In fact, sometimes the more we surrender to God, the more we'll see our sin and our need for growth. That's called sanctification. Embrace these spiritual struggles as an opportunity for growth. Don't give up!\nYour Old Friends Can Still Be Friends Just because you've become a Christian doesn't mean you have to cut off everyone from your past. You might find that some won't understand, but your goal is not to antagonize, but to love them. Show them grace, and explain your new commitment with kindness, when appropriate.\nChristian Love Demands the Best Of You Jesus said, \"By this shall all people know you are My disciples, if you have love one for another\" (John 13:35). This love involves practical care, patience, understanding, and putting other people's needs above our own. It's an act of willfulness, not just warm feelings. Christianity without love looks really empty.\nPart Two: 9 Additional Lessons For More Experienced Followers of Christ Continue Learning And Loving God's Word Don't let your time with Scripture wane. As an older believer, your relationship to the Bible should deepen and broaden. We want to know Jesus more, understand our calling, and have a greater grasp of what God asks of us. This entails a lifetime of learning from the text.\nStruggle Can Become An Opportunity Embrace those times when you feel distance from God. The Psalms are full of the writers expressing their inner turmoil as they follow God. These challenges can lead to needed adjustments and spiritual growth.\nOld Myths Must Go Let's face it, we all carry misunderstandings, either from our former lives or from misguided understanding of the faith. As time goes on and we get more experienced, it is important to let go of misconceptions and not let them hinder the strength of your faith.\nYou're Not Fooling Anyone: Holiness Is Vital Yes, we all stumble, but holiness is still essential. Christianity is not a navel-gazing, self-help hobby. As the years go by, it is vital that our character reflect our faith. We should be marked by things like compassion, kindness, long suffering, and forgiveness.\nGently Give Criticism With experience comes the possibility of influence. Exercise this influence gently and with much wisdom. It's not just about doing the right thing; it's also about the way we do it. Gentleness is one of the fruits of the Spirit.\nThe World Will Always Be Watching Being a follower of Christ is about more than ourselves. The world is always watching. While the ultimate call to us is to please God, the Lord uses our lives to model His ways to others. And our integrity, compassion, and mercy will go a long way to proclaiming the Gospel to those outside the faith.\nLife Has Ups And Downs We're going to have our share of setbacks. But we must remember that God is in the restoration business. He's promised to pick us up, dust us off, and restore us according to His loving purpose for each of us. Trust Him through the dark times.\nThe World's Praise Is Temporal, God's Approval Is Eternal Acknowledge your joy in seeing the Lord work, even through the struggles. Know this life is preparation for the next - our reward comes from God's hands, not man's. Success is a step-stool for ministry, not the destination. Our hearts should be set on eternity, not the fleeting accolades of the world.\nLook For Ways To Mentor You've walked a distance with the Lord. Now it's time to pass on your learning. It can be through formal mentoring, small groups, informal chats at church or coffee, or a thousand other ways. As older believers, we have much to share.\nWhether you've just started following Jesus or you're deep into this walk, we're all learning. The goal of each of these lists is to stimulate thought and conversation to strengthen and encourage us in this journey.\nComments No comments yet.
